Агротехникалық күрес (Agrotechnical control) – This typically involves agricultural practices or techniques, such as crop rotation, planting, irrigation methods, etc. It's not specifically about using natural predators.\n\nB. Биологиялық күрес (Biological control) – This is the use of living organisms to control pests, such as using ladybugs to eat aphids. This fits perfectly.\n\nC. Механикалық күрес (Mechanical control) – This involves physical removal or barriers, like traps, handpicking pests, or barriers. This is not the case here.\n\nD. Химиялық күрес (Chemical control) – Using pesticides or chemicals to control pests. Ladybugs are not chemicals.\n\nE.

Митохондриялар - This is the mitochondria. Mitochondria are well known as the \"powerhouses\" or \"power stations\" of the cell because they generate ATP through cellular respiration.\n\nB. Лизосома - Lysosomes are involved in digestion and waste removal inside the cell, not power production.\n\nC. Центриоль - Centrioles are involved in cell division and help organize microtubules.\n\nD. Хлоропластар - Chloroplasts are involved in photosynthesis in plant cells, capturing sunlight to produce energy, but they are not generally called the \"power station\" in animal cells.\n\nE. Ядрошық - This is the nucleolus, involved in producing ribosomal RNA, not energy production.\n\nSince the question is \"Power station of the cell\" in general biology (commonly referring to animal cells), the best answer is mitochondria (Митохондриялар).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n[A]",

         "First, let's understand what the question is asking. It asks about \"biotic factors.\" \n\n**Biotic factors** refer to living components in an ecosystem that affect other organisms – such as predation, competition, disease, and symbiosis. These involve interactions between living organisms.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. \"Батпақты жерді құрғату.\"  \nTranslation: Draining a swampy land.  \nThis is an abiotic change because it involves altering the physical environment, not directly about living organisms interacting.\n\nB. \"Жыртқыштардың жемтігін аулап жеуі.\"  \nTranslation: Predators hunting and eating their prey.  \nThis is a classic example of a biotic factor because it involves living organisms interacting (predation).\n\nC. \"Жыртқыштарды аулау.\"  \nTranslation: Hunting predators.  \nThis action involves humans (living organisms) affecting predators. This could also be biotic, but often human hunting is considered more of an anthropogenic impact rather than natural biotic factor. However, humans are living organisms, so hunting can be a biotic factor, but more indirect.\n\nD. \"Өзендердің сай - салаға ағып кетуі.\"  \nTranslation: Rivers flowing into valleys.  \nThis is an abiotic factor – movement of water in the environment.\n\nE. \"Жыртқыштарды ату.\"  \nTranslation: Shooting predators.  \nSimilar to option C, human action, again more anthropogenic.\n\nBetween B, C, and E:\n\nB is a natural biotic interaction (predators and prey), which aligns most directly with biotic factors. C and E describe human intervention, which while involving living organisms, is often considered separately as human impact rather than natural biotic factors.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B.\n\n[B]",

Leptotene – chromosomes begin to condense.\n2. Zygotene – homologous chromosomes start pairing, synapsis begins.\n3. Pachytene – synapsis is complete; crossing-over occurs (exchange of genetic material).\n4. Diplotene – homologous chromosomes start to separate but remain connected at chiasmata (sites of crossing-over).\n5. Diakinesis – final stage of prophase I where chromosomes condense further.\n\nGiven the options, which are in Russian or related languages:\n\nA. Метафаза (Metaphase) – chromosomes line up in the middle of the cell.\nB. Телофаза (Telophase) – chromosomes reach poles; nuclear envelope reforms.\nC. Зиготена (Zygotene) – early prophase I stage where homologous chromosomes begin to pair (synapsis).\nD. Диплотена (Diplotene) – stage where homologous chromosomes begin to separate but remain connected at chiasmata.\n\n\"The stage that connects certain parts of paired chromosomes\" likely refers to when homologous chromosomes remain connected at chiasmata.\n\nDuring diplotene, chromosomes start to separate but stay connected at points called chiasmata, which correspond to crossover sites.\n\nSo the correct stage is Diplotene.\n\nAnswer: [D]",

         "Let's analyze the question and options carefully.\n\nThe question asks about an important feature of leguminous plants.\n\nLeguminous plants (Leguminosae or Fabaceae family) are known for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobium) in nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) into ammonia, which the plant can use for growth. This process enriches soil nitrogen content, reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Өзек түкшелері арқылы су сіңіреді  \nTranslation: Absorbs water through vascular root hairs  \n- All plants absorb water through root hairs, so this is not unique to leguminous plants.\n\nB. Тамыр түкшелері арқылы бос азотты сіңіреді  \nTranslation: Absorbs free nitrogen through root hairs  \n- Legumes do not absorb free atmospheric nitrogen directly through root hairs; instead, nitrogen fixation is done by symbiotic bacteria inside root nodules. However, this option may be the closest because it mentions nitrogen and roots.\n\nC. Сабақ түкшелері арқылы бос азотты сіңіреді  \nTranslation: Absorbs free nitrogen through stem hairs  \n- Plants do not absorb nitrogen through stem hairs; nitrogen fixation is associated with roots.\n\nD. Жапырақ түкшелері арқылы оттегін сіңіреді  \nTranslation: Absorbs oxygen through leaf hairs  \n- Plants typically absorb oxygen for respiration through stomata, not leaf hairs. This is not a defining feature of legumes.\n\nConsidering the above, the key feature of legumes is their nitrogen-fixing capability via root nodules (related to root hairs or root structures). While legumes do not directly absorb free nitrogen through root hairs, this is the closest option describing their interaction with nitrogen.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\n[B] Тамыр түкшелері арқылы бос азотты сіңіреді\n\nFinal answer: [B]",
